  <TextRight color="green">The challenge of this campaign was to make people understand what Design Does*. To do so we took everyday objects, like a pen, and showed them that apart from the original functionality it was conceived for, its design is used in many other ways and for many different purposes. For better & for worse.</TextRight>
